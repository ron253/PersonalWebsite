                <p>
                  I call myself an entrepreneurial, creative thinker because I enjoy innovating. Innovating to me means putting my ideas into reality.
                  Whether that may be developing side-businessess or coding passion projects, I enjoy doing things that challenges me to problem-solve, critical think, and achieve what others think are "impossible".
                  The most important life philosophy of mine that I hold strongly throughout my life is this phrase from the Bible, "Do not work for food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal
                  life <i>(John 6:27).</i>" I interpret this as seeking knowlege and understanding of this world through my God's given gift of being able to think, reason, and explore. I do this by seeking opportunities that fosters self-improvement, such as joining ToastMasters to develop public speaking skills or taking courses on my spare time to enhance my knowledge.
                  Innovating challenges me to self-learn and adapt to changes, inspire others with my creative ideas, and stepping outside my comfort zone.

                  I strive to do the best with what I have, and I approach life with optimism, positivity, and curiosity.

                <h1 class = "title"><span>What got me into programming?</span></h1>
                <p>
                  I wasn't interested in programming at all when I took my first programming class as a high school senior. I didn't like it at first because I didn't understand how code can be applied to real world problems besides knowing how to print "Hello World" in JAVA. What got me hooked to programming was my first internship as a Gender Equity researcher in which I thought of an innovative approach called web-scraping to automate the process of reviewing pronouns on City websites. This experience taught me how to crtical think on the job by
                  using my creativity to find innovative ways to solve a problem, and web scraping was something I came up with to make my task easier by not having to manually search for the type of pronouns used across different City web pages.
                  I fell in love with programming ever since because I feel like I am playing with magic by being able to innovate anything I want with code. But honestly speaking, I love coding because I just enjoy googling and stealing passwords haha jk. 
                   I am the type of person who likes to know what, why, and how something works, and the opportunity to intern at ITA
                  allowed me to discover those questions about code along the way.
